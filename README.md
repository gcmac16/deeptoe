# deeptoe

A while ago I stumbled upon an Ultimate Tic Toe site (that i can no longer find the link to). I started playing the computer and beat it within a few tries. Finding this unsatisfactory, I set out to build an AI computer version of the game that I wouldn't be able to beat. I eventually gave up in favor of other projects I would also go on to not finish. 

But, thanks to the novel coronavirus I am now stuck at home and this project is picking up steam again, so here I am. I started from scratch (because the old code sucked) and am trying to get a basic version working. I'll update the link here when it is actually doing something.
